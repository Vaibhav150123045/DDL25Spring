🚀 Distributed Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I built to explore and implement the key components of distributed deep learning systems. From scratch implementations to scalable design patterns, each module represents a crucial building block in understanding how large-scale training systems work in real-world machine learning workflows.

📂 Project Structure

🧱 1. Microbatch Pipeline with Model Parallelism

Implemented a training pipeline that processes microbatches across multiple devices using model parallelism. This project mimics the behavior of pipelined execution in large-scale architectures where the model is too large to fit on a single device.

🔧 Highlights: Forward-pass pipelining, inter-device communication, microbatch scheduling.

⸻

🧠 2. Autograd Engine from Scratch

Built a complete autograd engine in pure Python, capable of dynamically building computational graphs and backpropagating gradients through them.

🔧 Highlights: Custom Tensor class, dynamic graph construction, chain rule for gradients, backpropagation.

⸻

⚙️ 3. Low-Level PyTorch Engine

Reconstructed the forward and backward passes using low-level PyTorch operations, bypassing autograd. This helped deepen my understanding of what happens under the hood during gradient computation.

🔧 Highlights: Manual gradient flow using PyTorch tensors, autograd disabled, verified against PyTorch’s outputs.

⸻

💽 4. Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) Implementation

Manually implemented a simplified version of PyTorch’s DDP module to perform synchronized training across multiple processes.

🔧 Highlights: Gradient averaging, all-reduce communication, multi-process training, reproducibility.

⸻

🔁 5. AllReduce Simulation

Simulated the core behavior of AllReduce, the key operation behind synchronizing gradients across GPUs in distributed training.

🔧 Highlights: Thread-based simulation, barrier synchronization, performance profiling.

⸻

🌍 6. Large Batch Training with Gradient Accumulation

Implemented gradient accumulation logic to simulate large batch training under memory constraints. Compared the behavior of true large batch training vs accumulated mini-batches.

🔧 Highlights: Batch scheduling, parameter update consistency, validation of equivalence.

⸻

🔬 7. Gradient Checking

Implemented numerical gradient checking to verify the correctness of backpropagation logic.

🔧 Highlights: Finite difference approximation, validation against analytical gradients.

💡 Why This Repo?

Most deep learning engineers use tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow as black boxes. With this project, I went a level deeper — building the core mechanisms from scratch to truly understand how distributed training works in practice.

Whether it’s writing my own autograd engine, simulating AllReduce, or debugging parallel training across processes, every component was designed to teach myself systems-level thinking in deep learning.
